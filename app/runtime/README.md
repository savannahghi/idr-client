# IDR Client Runtime

IDR(Integrated Data Repository) Client is an *ETL framework* that can be used
to build tools that draw/extract data from a data source, perform some
processing on the extracted data and finally drain the processed data to a data
sink. This repository contains implementations of the reference runtime of the
IDR Client.
